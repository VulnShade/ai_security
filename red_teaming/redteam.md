- [Attack Techniques](redteam_techniques.md) - Methods for testing and bypassing LLM safeguards
- [Example Assessment](assessment.md) - Complete walkthrough of an LLM security assessment

## 🛠️ Tools

### Prompt Injection Testing
- [Automation Framework](tools/prompt_injection/automation.md) - Automated testing of prompt injection attacks
- [prompts.csv](tools/prompt_injection/payloads/prompts.csv) - Collection of known effective prompt injection payloads including:

## 📋 Testing Workflow
1. Identify vulnerabilities using [vulnerabilities guide](vulnerabilities.md)
2. Select appropriate [attack techniques](redteam_techniques.md)
3. Use [automation tools](tools/prompt_injection/automation.md) for testing
4. Document results following [assessment template](assessment.md)
